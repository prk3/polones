# Polones desktop

This app lets you play NES games on your computer. It's rather bare-bones, expect more features in the future.

## Installation

If you're on Linux desktop, you can download a pre-built binary from [https://github.com/prk3/polones/releases](https://github.com/prk3/polones/releases). Drop in a directory with executables, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`, make it executable (`chmod +x ...`), and you're good to go.

If you're on a different platform, you'll have to build polones-desktop from source.

## Running a game

Execute the program, passing path to a game file as the first argument.

```sh
polones-desktop /path/to/a/game.nes
```
